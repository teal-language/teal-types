# How to update this

The `vim.d.tl` file is autogenerated by the `autogen` shell script that does the following:
 - compiles `autogen_tl`
 - runs `nvim` and does a `:luafile` to run the compile file to generate the api info
 - removes the compiled `autogen_tl`

So to add types, rather than directly modifying `vim.d.tl` modify `template` which will be used to generate `vim.d.tl`

Ideally, the version you generate the types for should be the latest stable version. The cool kids that run the latest dev branch can handle generating their own types :)

## Some notes

Neovim's api (like a lot of Lua code) has types that are not describable through Teal's type system. The most noticeable are:
 - Luv's `handle` types all derive from a base class, and Teal has no notion of inheritance nor composition
 - There are a few function arguments that rely on unions that Teal cannot discriminate between at runtime
